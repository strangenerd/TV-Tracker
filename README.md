TV Tracker is simple (simple is a generous word, its very basic) web app to keep track of the movies and I created Tv tracker to learn more about webdevelopment. 

If you want to make an instance on your own. 1st you need to clone this repository and then you need to initialise the database by opening up a terminal and `cd` to the TV Tracker directory and execute following commands line by line.

```
python
from app import db
db.create_aLL()
```

And then whenever you want to open the app run `flask run` command or `python app.py` command.
